/**
 * Asynchronously connects to Sentience and requests account access.

 * This function first checks whether the SentienceSDK instance is initialized.
 * If not, it initializes the instance. It then makes a request to access accounts
 * using the active provider. Throws an error if the provider is undefined.
 *
 * @param instance The SentienceSDK instance to connect to.
 * @returns Promise resolving to the result of the 'eth_requestAccounts' request.
 * @throws Error if the activeProvider is undefined.
