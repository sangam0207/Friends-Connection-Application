/**
 * Initiates the Sentience desktop onboarding process.
 *
 * This function destroys the existing Ethereum object and removes it from the window context,
 * effectively clearing any prior Ethereum-related state. It then instantiates a new MetaMaskOnboarding object
 * and starts the onboarding process for Sentience on desktop platforms.
 *
 * @param instance The SentienceInstaller instance used for debugging purposes.
 * @returns Promise<void> This function returns a promise that resolves to void.
