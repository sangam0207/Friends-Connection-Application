/**
 * Sets up the extension preferences for the Sentience SDK instance.
 *
 * This function tries to identify if the Sentience extension is installed and active in the browser.
 * If the extension is found, the relevant Sentience SDK instance properties are updated accordingly.
 * The function also checks if the SDK is running in Sentience's in-app browser on mobile devices.
 * Based on these checks, the function returns an object containing information about whether the
 * extension is preferred, whether the initialization process should return early, and the detected
 * Sentience browser extension.
 *
 * @param {SentienceSDK} instance - The SentienceSDK instance for which extension preferences will be set up.
 * @returns {Object} An object containing the following properties:
 *   - preferExtension: Boolean indicating if the extension is preferred.
 *   - shouldReturn: Boolean indicating if the initialization process should return early.
 *   - sentienceBrowserExtension: The detected Sentience browser extension, if any.
