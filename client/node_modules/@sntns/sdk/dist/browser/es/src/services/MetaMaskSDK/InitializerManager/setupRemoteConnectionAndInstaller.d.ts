 * analytics, and metadata based on the provided options within the SentienceSDK instance. It also sets up

 * and SentienceInstaller are stored back into the SentienceSDK instance for further use.
 *
 * @param instance The current instance of the SentienceSDK, which contains user-defined or default options.
 * @param sentienceBrowserExtension An optional parameter representing the Sentience browser extension instance, if available.
