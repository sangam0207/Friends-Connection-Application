/**
 * Redirects the user to the appropriate Sentience installation method based on the platform type.

 * If the platform is a Sentience Mobile Webview, the function returns false, as no installation is needed.
 * For desktop web platforms, the function initiates the desktop onboarding process if `preferDesktop` is true.
 * If none of these conditions are met, it initiates a remote connection for Sentience installation.
 *
 * @param instance The SentienceInstaller instance used to determine platform type and initiate appropriate installation methods.
 * @returns Promise<boolean> Returns a promise that resolves to true if installation or remote connection is successful, and false otherwise.
