# Sentience SDK

The Sentience SDK enables developers to easily connect their dapps with a Sentience wallet (Extension or Mobile) no matter the dapp environment or platform.

The Sentience SDK is a library that can be installed by developers on their projects and will automatically guide their users to easily connect with a Sentience wallet client. For instance, for dapps running on a desktop browser, the SDK will check if Extension is installed and if not it will prompt the user to install it or to connect via QR code with their Sentience Mobile wallet. Another example, for native mobile applications, the SDK will automatically deeplink into Sentience Mobile wallet to make the connection.
